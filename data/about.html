    <p>Every day the International Space Station makes more than 15 orbits around the earth, and sometimes is passes over your head. Most of the time you don't notice. You're busy living your life, and forget about the astronauts up there doing experiments for science. That's why this device is created. It notifies you when the ISS is near and even when it's visible in the sky. That way you never forget about this great achievement of mankind, and you will always know when to go outside to watch it fly by.</p>
    
    <p>Knowing where a satellite is at a specific moment isn't that easy. There are a lot of forces working on a satellite and only using a kepler orbit won't suffice for calculating its position. That's why the simplified perturbations model (SGP) was made. It tries to correct the error caused by the imperfect Earth shape, atmospheric drag, radiation from the sun, and gravitational effects of the sun and the moon. Even with all these corrections the orbit will slowly decay from the actual position. Using a recent two-line element set (TLE) will counter this. These sets are made from observations from NORAD and define the orbit of the satellite around the epoch time. This device will automatically update the TLE, so that the error is reduced as much as possible.</p>
    
    <p>Sattrack was made as a hobby and learning project. There is no warranty that it will work perfectly. If you find a bug, report it on the <a href="https://github.com/Hopperpop/Sattrack">Github page</a> and hopefully it will be fixed.</p>
