    Sattrack is a project that started simple, but ended with more features than I ever could imagine. The first version was a single Led that turned on when the ISS overflew. It used an API to find the rise and set time, but it couldn't tell how high it will rise or if it will be a visible pass. <br>
    After I found the SGP4 model, all those limitations disappeared. The model is used to find the position of the sattelite in real time and for predicting overpasses. Most information on how to do this, was found on the CelesTrak website.<br>
    <br>
    This project was also a learning exercise. When I started the project, I wasn't familiar with C++ and webdesign. You can't say that I ended as a good developer, but now I have at least some understanding about those topics and hopefully it becomes usefull some day.
